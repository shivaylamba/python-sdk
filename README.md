## Getting Started

Install Memori:

```bash
pip install memori
```

## Example with OpenAI

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from memori import Memori

client = OpenAI(...)
mem = Memori().openai.register(client)
```

## Attribution

To get the most out of Memori, you want to attribute your LLM interactions to an entity (think person, place or thing; like a user) and a process (think your agent, LLM interaction or program).

If you do not provide any attribution, Memori cannot make memories for you.

```python
mem.attribution(entity_id="12345", process_id="my-ai-bot")
```

## Session Management

Memori uses sessions to group your LLM interactions together. For example, if you have an agent that executes multiple steps you want those to be recorded in a single session.

By default, Memori handles setting the session for you but you can start a new session or override the session by executing the following:

```python
mem.new_session()
```

or

```python
session_id = mem.config.session_id

# ...

mem.set_session(session_id)
```

## Configure Your Database

1. Run this command once, via CI/CD or anytime you update Memori.

    ```python
    Memori(conn=db_session_factory).config.storage.build()
    ```

2. Instantiate Memori with the connection factory.

    ```python
    from openai import OpenAI
    from memori import Memori

    client = OpenAI(...)
    mem = Memori(conn=db_session_factory).openai.register(client)
    ```

## Full Example Using MySQL, SQLAlchemy and OpenAI

```python
from memori import Memori
from openai import OpenAI
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

engine = create_engine("mysql+pymysql://dbuser:dbpassword@dbhost/dbname")
db_session_factory = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

client = OpenAI()

mem = Memori(conn=db_session_factory).openai.register(client)
mem.attribution(entity_id="user_123", process_id="astronomer_agent")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What color is Mars?"}]
)

# The planet Mars is red.
print(response.choices[0].message.content)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "That planet we are talking about, in order from the sun, which one is it?"
        }
    ]
)

# Mars is the 4th planet from the sun.
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Memori Advanced Augmentation

Memories are tracked at several different levels:

- entity: think person, place, or thing; like a user
- process: think your agent, LLM interaction or program
- session: the current interactions between the entity, process and the LLM

Memori's Advanced Augmentation enhances memories at each of these levels with:

- attributes
- events
- facts
- people
- preferences
- relationships
- rules
- skills

Memori knows who your user is, what tasks your agent handles and creates unparalleled context between the two. Augmentation occurs in the background incurring no latency.

By default, Memori Advanced Augmentation is available without an account but rate limited. When you need increased limits, [sign up for Memori Advanced Augmentation](https://memorilabs.ai/sign-up/github) or execute the following:

```bash
python3 -m memori sign-up <email_address>
```

Memori Advanced Augmentation is always free for developers!

Once you've obtained an API key, simply set the following environment variable:

```bash
export MEMORI_API_KEY=[api_key]
```

## Managing Your Quota

At any time, you can check your quota by executing the following:

```bash
python3 -m memori quota
```

Or by checking your account at [https://memorilabs.ai/](https://memorilabs.ai/). If you have reached your IP address quota, sign up and get an API key for increased limits.

If your API key exceeds its quota limits we will email you and let you know.

## Running Memori Advanced Augmentation

The process of augmenting memories is technically complex and requires time for processing. Your application should benefit from the power of augmentation without the latency. In order to achieve this we have designed the system to use a background thread after your call to an LLM returns.

Upon return from the LLM, we automatically trigger a call to Memori Advanced Augmentation, wait for the response and write all of the newly created memories directly into your database.

Our team of engineers and AI researchers are always working to make sure that Memori creates the best, more relevant memories for you. We will continue to improve both all of the SDK's we support as well as the Memori Advanced Augmentation system.
